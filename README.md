# Project Lim[b]itless

A collaborative research project between the Center for Human Frontiers and UCSD's McKittrick Lab purposed to streamline a distributed infrastructure to dramatically reduce the cost while improving access to prosthetic limbs among the worldâ€™s 40 million amputees.

## Goal

The goal to reduce cost of acquiring prosthetic limbs can be achieved in many ways, all of which we propose through technology. Our goal is to eliminate the need for an amputee to meet with a professional prosthetist and avoid the high cost of mainstream development, which involves unique casting and molding of prosthetic limbs done by real prostheticians.

In our proposed infrastructure, an amputee would be able to access a virtual clinic, through our mobile application. Our app eliminates the need for an amputee to visit a prosthetist in person. All they have to do is take photos of their residual limb and our software at UCSD allows for the compilation of 3D models from just 2D images.
